# [API](../../) [Consumption Navigator](../): Reuse

API reuse represents a possible cost reduction (the ability to re-use existing interfaces to solve new problems) and also represents a risk (reuse creates dependencies). While APIs are often recommended as a way to increase service reuse it is important to balance the potential risk against any perceived gains. Making APIs reusable can often mean adjusting their design and implementation to make sure minor changes in the API does not cause other API consumers to experience breakage. Most of this concern is addressed through changes in the API _provider_. However API _consumers_ need to keep re-use issues in mind when consuming any API.

* Does your company have an API Reuse policy or statement of principle?
  
* Is it possible for you to use the same API to solve more than one problem?
  
* Do you set reuse KPIs and monitor the reuse stats of the APIs you are consuming?
  
* Is there a feedback channel for API consumers that when using APIs the API provider can learn about what's working well and what's maybe not working so well?
