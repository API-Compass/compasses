# [CAM](../../) [Consumption Navigator](../): Rightsizing

Platforms that run on APIs for API consumers necessarily exhibit stability problems because of possible problems with the stability of all communicating components in the network, as well as with the communications fabric as well. In order to make these stability risks more manageable, it makes sense to revisit the question of how many components are communicating, and how the communications fabric looks like. It may be a worthwhile investment to refactor components, both in terms of stability, as well as in terms of scalability, which can be impacted substantially by the number of components, the type of components, and the way in which components communicate.

* Do you have a process for evaluating the performance of your API consumers?
  
* Do you use correlation IDs to track transactions throughout your ecosystem?
  
* Do you have a dashboard that records the typical transaction time (in length) as well as reach (# of components touching the transaction)?
  
* Do you have a process for evaluating the effectiveness of interactions with consumed APIs?
