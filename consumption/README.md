# [CAM](../) Consumption Compass

The _[CAM](../) Consumption Compass_ helps to treat the dependencies created by API consumption more responsibly. Consuming APIs is a common way to separate software components. This is good in terms of modularization, but also means that each API is a dependency on an external component. In particular when technical and organizational control of the API consumer and the consumed API differ, it is important to manage API consumption in a responsible way.  The consumption compass addresses concerns that are important for maximizing loose coupling between API-coupled components.
