# API [Product](./) [Navigator](../): Design

We've all heard about Design Thinking recently but is your organization considering API Design as a mandatory step to delivering quality APIs? In this topic of the API Product Navigator, we will see how consumer-led design enables the right perspectives, granularity, and usability to delight those using APIs. We assess if there is enough balance of individual API scope with that of an entire landscape.

* Have you identified (based on the API product strategy) who the API product is designed for, and included that perspective in the design process?

* Is the design balancing the needs and optimization potential for the individual API product with those for the API landscape? Will it work well when used in conjunction with other APIs of the landscape?

* Given the API's style and technology, is it using a recommended and/or standardized description format that makes it easier for consumers to gain an initial understanding of the API, possibly aided by tooling they can use?

* Does the design deliver a useful but minimal set of capabilities so that it can be extended based on the feedback of consumers?
