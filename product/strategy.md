# [CAM](../) [Product Compass](./): Strategy

The ultimate goal of APIs is to help an organization on its digital transformation journey, meaning that APIs are a technical way to design, build, manage, and interconnect the capabilities of an organization in digital value chains. The strategic goal of this exercise to maximize the overall value of the entire API landscape. With this goal in mind, each API product should align its own product-specific strategy with the overall API strategy of the organization. This holistic view of strategy allows to balance decisions between optimizing for individual value, and the greater good of the value in the context of the organization.

* Do you have a clearly defined and documented reason why the API product exists?

* What is the value the API product provides for consumers? Have you identified potential value chains and they are part of the design process?

* Are there clearly defined criteria and indicators (such as OKR or KPI) that allow you to say whether the strategic goal has been reached or not?

* How do you provide controls to ensure adequate coverage of the product pillars over the lifecycle of the product?

* Can your strategy be adjusted when the indicators show that it needs to be?
