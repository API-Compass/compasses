# [CAM](../) [Product Compass](./): Change Management

In a fast-moving world of digital products as your competitive advantage, one thing is unavoidable: Change. Not only will your digital products need to evolve with business needs but they will need to be designed and built with change and evolution in mind from the outset, lest they become obsolete out of the gate. This topic of the API Product Compass will consider how well you are anticipating change not only after release but in the lifecycle stages leading up to it.

* Does your design include a plan how to make changes to APIs?

* Is the change management process manual or automated?

* Do you have an idea of what your API should and shouldn't be, so that you can more easily decide which evolution paths you are trying to keep open?

* If your design does not plan on evolving the API itself, do you have a plan how to operate multiple versions and how to manage the consumers of these multiple versions?

* If your design includes a plan for evolving the API itself, do you document this clearly so that consumer know what to expect?

* Does your documentation include a history of changes so that it is possible for consumers to understand how the API evolved?
 
* Do you have a plan how to deprecate/decommission the API, and how this will be communicated to active consumers?
