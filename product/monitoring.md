# API [Product](./) [Navigator](../): Monitoring

With increasing time and scale of an evolving API landscapes, it becomes important that usage and status information for API products is available, accessible, and useful. Monitoring is necessary on a basic technical level, and at that level can be driven by relatively uniform metrics of how an API product is doing. But beyond that basic technical level, additional insights can help a lot to better understand how the API-based value chains in an organization perform, and how they are utilized.

* Is all the monitoring information collected in a way that it can be easily accessed and reused?

* Do you have defined SLAs (internal or external) for your API product and do you have alert mechanisms when the SLAs are breached?

* Does your monitoring practice capture information that aligns with measurements such as KPIs and OKRs?

* For any data that is being collected as part of monitoring, it needs to be guaranteed that this data is being used according to its usage policies (e.g., PII may be problematic if it gets stored and used outside of the API product itself).
