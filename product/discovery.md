# [CAM](../) [Product Compass](./): Discovery

One of the benefits of an API first approach is being able to deliver digital products more efficiently and quickly because the capabilities packaged through well-designed API products can be reused. You can't reuse something no one can find, though! Discovery should not be accidental for consumers, both business and technical. This topic of the API Product Compass addresses the ease to which your APIs can be searched for, identified, and discovered as an essential part of the planning phase of the lifecycle. 

* How do consumers discover available APIs? Is there one place or are there multiples places where discovery can start?

* Given the strategic goals of the API product, is marketing targeting the appropriate channels to make sure that potential users can easily discover the API?

* Based on the available documentation and the strategic goals, does discovery the experience take into account the best way how potential new users can understand the API product once they discover it?

* Based on the change management strategy, is it always the most recent version that is made available through all discovery channels?

* Is discovery and reuse of APIs a consistent part of API product planning?

* Do you have rich metadata/documentation to make API discovery easier and targeted?
