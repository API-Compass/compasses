# [CAM](../) [Product Compass](./): Development

Most organizations have fine-tuned and added sufficient control and automation to their DevOps pipelines in order to be more agile, reduce defects, and shorten release times. In this topic of the API Product Compass we consider how to bring your API product pipeline and workflow into the mix and assess any current gaps. APIs are better when developers gain understanding the full API landscape and the value that consumers will gain from their development efforts.

* How are the design and development efforts coordinated when changes are made to the API definition?

* Does your API product use your organization's portfolio of technologies and tools to be used during the API development process throughout the entire lifecycle?

* Is the development process driven in a way that consumer feedback is gathered early and continuously and is used to evolve the product (i.e., agile and DevSecOps principles)?
