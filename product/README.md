# [CAM](../) Product Compass

The _[CAM](../) Product Compass_ assesses the current state of an API product. It uses _pillars_ for a structured assessment, allowing product managers to understand the current state, and to identify potential areas of investment. The goal of the product compass is to serve as guidance for an API product's maturity journey. Typically, API products emphasize different pillars differently throughout their product lifecycle, and the product compass helps to accompany this journey of an API product with a structured perspective of how strong its individual pillars are developed.
