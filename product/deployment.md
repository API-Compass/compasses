# API [Product](./) [Navigator](../): Deployment

Deployment is more than just the act of "putting something live". It's about being ready and anticipating and dealing with change. In this topic of the API Product Navigator we consider deployment from everything that needs to be deployed throughout the API product lifecycle to see how joined up your current workflows or pipelines are. Organizations need to ensure adequate control while not sacrificing speed and innovation in product releases.

* Is deployment automated or is it a manual process?

* Do you have a failover model where you can recover when deployment fails?

* Do you have a process to check criteria (e.g., the testing process or audits) for deployment readiness?

* Deployment automation for the API product is done in line with the strategic goals, so that deployments can be rolled out fast enough.

* Deployment is aligned with the change management principles, so that if necessary, multiple versions can be operated and potentially discovered in parallel.

* Deployment decisions are structured in a way so that given the constraints of when to release and who gets to decide, deployment can happen as fast as possible.

* Deployment scalability has been taken into account, so that scaling the product up when required is supported by the deployment packaging model and by the deployment environment.
