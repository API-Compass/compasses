# [CAM](../) [Product Compass](./): Documentation

APIs are the communication channels of digital value chains, and in an ideal world, channels could be built by knowing about all available APIs, picking the right ones to design a new value chain, and then implementing it. In the real world, things are a little more complicated and APIs are not completely self-describing or self-documenting beyond a rather technical level. Documentation helps to understand an API both in terms of the value it provides (non-technical documentation) as well as in terms of how to use it (technical documentation). Investment in documentation depends heavily on the lifecycle stage of an API as well as on the intended audience. The documentation pillar makes sure that documentation is at the right level for an individual API product's maturity and goals.

* Is the API value documented on a non-technical level?

* Is the documentation and learning experience for the API based on the strategic goals of the API product?

* Is documentation for the API integrated into the API landscape as much possible, given the strategic goals of the API product?

* Does the API product provide its documentation assets in reusable ways, so that they can be integrated into other documentation services (such as a portal) as needed?

* Is documentation produced and published so that it is easy to identify the API product version the documentation is for?

* Does the API have a well-documented lifecycle and change management policy?

* Are you supporting metadata that can help with discovery of API products?

* Are there communication channels for API consumers to be alerted of API product updates?

* Is there a published channel for consumers to provide feedback about the API product?
